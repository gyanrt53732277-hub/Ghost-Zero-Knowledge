## 🚨 The Real-World Problem

As AI evolves from **chatbots** to **autonomous agents**, they are being granted access to corporate credit cards, crypto wallets, and SaaS API keys to automatically negotiate software contracts, purchase cloud compute, and buy physical goods. 

However, **enterprises cannot adopt Web3 or AI payments without privacy and hard limits:**
1. **The Trust Gap:** If an AI agent has access to a treasury wallet, how do you mathematically guarantee it won't overspend or go rogue?
2. **The Privacy Dilemma:** If an AI agent pays a vendor on a public blockchain, the corporation’s entire supply chain, negotiated pricing, and vendor relationships are completely exposed to competitors (e.g. MEV bots and chain-analysis firms).

Today, AI spending limits are just "software toggles" on a centralized dashboard. If the server is breached or bugs occur, the AI can drain the wallet. 

---

## 💡 The Solution: Ghost 

**Ghost** is a verifiable autonomy layer built on the **Midnight Privacy Blockchain**. It wraps AI agents in cryptographic guardrails using **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proofs**. 

Instead of asking enterprises to "trust the platform," Ghost offers a mathematical guarantee:
> *"If an AI agent spends corporate funds, there is a Zero-Knowledge Proof that it stayed within its exact spending policy. If it cannot prove this, the Midnight Network blocks the transaction at the consensus layer."*

### Why Midnight?
Public blockchains (like Ethereum) cannot be used for B2B AI commerce because they leak sensitive financial data. Private blockchains (like Hyperledger) lack global liquidity and interoperability. 
**Midnight** solves this perfectly: It allows us to prove that a transaction is valid on a public ledger, while keeping the actual data (who the agent is paying, and exactly how much) completely private using advanced cryptography.

## 🚀 Core Production Features & Capabilities

Ghost has been upgraded to a full production-ready enterprise platform featuring 4 flagship capabilities:

### 1. 🤖 Multi-Agent Policy Orchestration
Allow enterprise administrators to set and enforce granular hierarchical policies across fleets of 100+ autonomous AI agents.
* **Hierarchical Fleet Nesting:** Supports multi-tiered fleet structures (e.g., *Global Enterprise &rarr; Engineering Dept &rarr; Cloud Procurement Swarm*) with full `parentFleetId` relational tree mapping.
* **Master Policy Inheritance:** Subordinate agents and child fleets automatically inherit parent budget guardrails with optional per-node limits.
* **Real-time Swarm Provisioning:** Deploy fleets of 100+ specialized agents with isolated cryptographic credentials in milliseconds.
* **Supabase Real-Time Sync:** Continuous state synchronization between local Zustand stores, PostgreSQL databases, and on-chain contracts.

---

### 2. 📦 Ghost Agent SDK (`@ghost/sdk`)
A lightweight, typed TypeScript/Node.js package enabling developers to plug Zero-Knowledge spending compliance directly into **LangChain**, **AutoGPT**, **Eliza**, and **AutoGen** agent workflows in 3 lines of code.

```bash
npm install @ghost/sdk
```

#### ⚡ 3-Line LangChain Integration
```typescript
import { GhostClient, GhostSpendingTool } from '@ghost/sdk';

// 1. Initialize client
const ghost = new GhostClient({ apiKey: process.env.GHOST_API_KEY, network: 'preprod' });

// 2. Attach ZK Spending Tool to LangChain agent
const tools = [new GhostSpendingTool(ghost, { agentId: 'procurement_bot_1' })];

// 3. LangChain executes under mathematical Zero-Knowledge guardrails!
const result = await agent.invoke({ input: "Order 5 cloud servers from AWS for $350" });
```

#### 🤖 3-Line AutoGPT & Eliza Guard Hook
```typescript
import { GhostClient, withGhostGuard } from '@ghost/sdk';

const ghost = new GhostClient({ apiKey: process.env.GHOST_API_KEY });

// Wrap autonomous execution loop with non-bypassable ZK policy interceptor
const safeExecute = withGhostGuard(ghost, { agentId: 'autogpt_node_42' }, executeCommand);

// Financial operations exceeding limits are blocked at runtime before wallet broadcast
await safeExecute({ command_name: 'purchase_item', arguments: { amount: 1500, merchant: 'AWS' } });
```

### 3. ⚡ Advanced Compact Circuits
Our native Midnight Compact contracts (`contracts/ghost.compact` and `contracts/ghost-advanced.compact`) have been upgraded with enterprise cryptographic primitives:
* **Dynamic Encrypted Threshold Re-balancing:** Allows enterprise admins to dynamically update the on-chain encrypted spending limits via the `rebalance_threshold` circuit without redeploying the smart contract.
* **Multi-Party ZK Approvals (> $50,000):** Transactions exceeding $50,000 mathematically require a multi-signer cryptographic authorization token (e.g. 2-of-3 corporate multi-sig) before settlement.
* **Private Allowlist Access:** Proves the agent is paying an authorized vendor without disclosing vendor identities on-chain.
* **Eligibility & Reputation Gate:** Verifies agent credentials and minimum credit scores in Zero-Knowledge without exposing underlying metrics.
* **Confidential Credentials:** Securely attaches API keys to agents and proves possession via ZK hash commitments.

---

### 4. 🌐 Mainnet / Preprod Production Deployment & Infrastructure
Complete end-to-end integration with Midnight indexers and proof servers for instant sub-second verification.
* **Dual Network Support (Preprod & Preview):** Live support with interactive network toggles, persistent storage, and automatic network-mismatch recovery.
* **Sub-Second Edge Caching Layer (`/api/indexer`, `/api/proof`):** In-memory and HTTP edge caching layer providing < 3ms response times to support high-throughput fleets of 100+ concurrent agents.
* **Dockerized Proving Sidecar (`docker/docker-compose.yml`):** Production multi-container setup containing the Midnight Prover Server and Ghost Application Gateway for secure on-premise VPC deployments.
* **Live System Health Monitor:** Real-time dashboard monitor tracking Proof Chain status, Indexer WebSocket connectivity, and block height synchronization.
